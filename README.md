# CoolerControl-Docker

This is my insanely basic attempt at putting [CoolerControl](https://gitlab.com/coolercontrol/coolercontrol) in a Docker container. Let me preface with: I don't really know what I'm doing! I barely pulled this together.

Why did I do this? I wanted a good way to manage the fans on my Unraid server, and CoolerControl is currently the best way to manage fans on Linux systems. 

The container is Debian slim running the CoolerControl AppImage.

### Configuration

Visit the [setup guide](https://github.com/guniv/CoolerControl-Docker/blob/main/setup.md) for information on setting this up on Unraid.
